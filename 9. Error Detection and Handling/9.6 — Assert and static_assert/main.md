## Preconditions, invariants, and postconditions

In programming, a precondition is any condition that must be true prior to the execution of some section of code (typically the body of a function). In the prior example, our check that y != 0 is a precondition that ensures y has a non-zero value before dividing by y.

Preconditions for a function are best placed at the top of a function, using an early return to return back to the caller if the precondition isn’t met. For example:
```cpp
void printDivision(int x, int y)
{
    if (y == 0) // handle
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not divide by zero\n";
        return; // bounce the user back to the caller
    }

    // We now know that y != 0
    std::cout << static_cast<double>(x) / y;
}
```
### Optional reading

This is sometimes known as the “bouncer pattern”, as you are bounced out of the function immediately when an error is detected.

The bouncer pattern has two major benefits:

    All your test cases are up-front, and the test case and code handling the error are together.
    You end up with less nesting.

Here’s what the non-bouncer version of this looks like:
```cpp

void printDivision(int x, int y)
{
    if (y != 0)
    {
        std::cout << static_cast<double>(x) / y;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not divide by zero\n";
        return; // bounce the user back to the caller
    }
}
```

This version is strictly worse, as the test case and code handling the error are more separated, and there is more nesting.

An invariant is a condition that must be true while some section of code is executing. This is often used with loops, where the loop body will only execute so long as the invariant is true.

For advanced readers

We talk about a common type of invariant called a “class invariant” in lesson 14.2 -- Introduction to classes.

Similarly, a postcondition is something that must be true after the execution of some section of code. Our function doesn’t have any postconditions.

## Assertions

Using a conditional statement to detect an invalid parameter (or to validate some other kind of assumption), along with printing an error message and terminating the program, is such a common method of detecting problems that C++ provides a shortcut method for doing this.

An assertion is an expression that will be true unless there is a bug in the program. If the expression evaluates to true, the assertion statement does nothing. If the conditional expression evaluates to false, an error message is displayed and the program is terminated (via std::abort). This error message typically contains the expression that failed as text, along with the name of the code file and the line number of the assertion. This makes it very easy to tell not only what the problem was, but where in the code the problem occurred. This can help with debugging efforts immensely.

In C++, runtime assertions are implemented via the assert preprocessor macro, which lives in the <cassert> header.

```cpp
#include <cassert> // for assert()
#include <cmath> // for std::sqrt
#include <iostream>

double calculateTimeUntilObjectHitsGround(double initialHeight, double gravity)
{
  assert(gravity > 0.0); // The object won't reach the ground unless there is positive gravity.

  if (initialHeight <= 0.0)
  {
    // The object is already on the ground. Or buried.
    return 0.0;
  }

  return std::sqrt((2.0 * initialHeight) / gravity);
}

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Took " << calculateTimeUntilObjectHitsGround(100.0, -9.8) << " second(s)\n";

  return 0;
}
```

## static_assert

C++ also has another type of assert called static_assert. A static_assert is an assertion that is checked at compile-time rather than at runtime, with a failing static_assert causing a compile error. Unlike assert, which is declared in the <cassert> header, static_assert is a keyword, so no header needs to be included to use it.

A static_assert takes the following form:

static_assert(condition, diagnostic_message)

If the condition is not true, the diagnostic message is printed. Here’s an example of using static_assert to ensure types have a certain size:

static_assert(sizeof(long) == 8, "long must be 8 bytes");
static_assert(sizeof(int) >= 4, "int must be at least 4 bytes");

int main()
{
	return 0;
}

On the author’s machine, when compiled, the compiler errors:

1>c:\consoleapplication1\main.cpp(19): error C2338: long must be 8 bytes

A few useful notes about static_assert:

    Because static_assert is evaluated by the compiler, the condition must be a constant expression.
    static_assert can be placed anywhere in the code file (even in the global namespace).
    static_assert is not deactivated in release builds (like normal assert is).
    Because the compiler does the evaluation, there is no runtime cost to a static_assert.

Prior to C++17, the diagnostic message must be supplied as the second parameter. Since C++17, providing a diagnostic message is optional.

Best practice

Favor static_assert over assert() whenever possible.

## Asserts vs error handling

Assertions and error handling are similar enough that their purposes can be confused, so let’s clarify.

Assertions are used to detect programming errors during development by documenting assumptions about things that should never happen. And if they do happen, it’s the fault of the programmer. Assertions do not allow recovery from errors (after all, if something should never happen, there’s no need to recover from it). Because asserts are typically compiled-out in release builds, you can put a lot of them in without worrying about performance, so there’s little reason not to use them liberally.

Error handling is used when we need to gracefully handle cases that could happen (however rarely) in a release build. These may either be recoverable issues (where the program can keep running), or unrecoverable issues (where the program has to shut down, but we can at least show a nice error message and ensure everything is cleaned up properly). Error detection and handling has both a runtime performance cost and a development time cost.

In some cases, it’s less clear what we should do. Consider a function like this:
```cpp
double getInverse(double x)
{
    return 1.0 / x;
}
```

If x is 0.0, this function will misbehave, and we need to guard against that. Should we use an assert or error handling? The best answer may be “both”.

During debugging, if this function is called when x is 0.0, that indicates a bug in our code somewhere, and we want to know that immediately. So an assert is definitely appropriate.

However, this could also reasonably happen in a release build (e.g. along an obscure path we didn’t test). If the assert is compiled out and we don’t have error handling, then this function will return something unexpected and misbehave. In such a case, it’s probably better to detect that and handle the case.

Our resulting function might look like this:

```cpp
double getInverse(double x)
{
    assert(x != 0.0);
    if (x == 0.0)
       // handle error somehow (e.g. throw an exception)

    return 1.0 / x;
}
```

Tip

Given this, we suggest the following:

    Use assertions to detect programming errors, incorrect assumptions, or conditions that should never occur in correct code. It is the programmer’s responsibility to fix these, so we want to catch them early.
    Use error handling for issues that we expect will occur during the normal operation of your program.
    Use both in cases where something isn’t supposed to occur, but we want to fail gracefully if it does.
