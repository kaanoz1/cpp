## goto statement:

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function

int main()
{
    double x{};
tryAgain: // this is a statement label
    std::cout << "Enter a non-negative number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x < 0.0)
        goto tryAgain; // this is the goto statement

    std::cout << "The square root of " << x << " is " << std::sqrt(x) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

## Illegal usage of goto:

There are two primary limitations to jumping: You can jump only within the bounds of a single function (you can’t jump out of one function and into another), and if you jump forward, you can’t jump forward over the initialization of any variable that is still in scope at the location being jumped to. For example:

```cpp
int main()
{
    goto skip;   // error: this jump is illegal because...
    int x { 5 }; // this initialized variable is still in scope at statement label 'skip'
skip:
    x += 3;      // what would this even evaluate to if x wasn't initialized?
    return 0;
}
```
