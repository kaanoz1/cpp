## Compound data types:

Fortunately, C++ supports a second set of data types: compound data types (also sometimes called composite data types) are types that are defined in terms of other existing data types. Compound data types have additional properties and behaviors that make them useful for solving certain types of problems.



C++ supports the following compound types:

    Functions
    C-style Arrays
    Pointer types:
        Pointer to object
        Pointer to function
    Pointer to member types:
        Pointer to data member
        Pointer to member function
    Reference types:
        L-value references
        R-value references
    Enumerated types:
        Unscoped enumerations
        Scoped enumerations
    Class types:
        Structs
        Classes
        Unions
