## How to approach a problem?

Once a problem has been identified, debugging the problem generally consists of six steps:

    Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that’s not working). We’ll discuss some strategies on how to do this in the next lesson.
    Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring.
    Determine how you’ll fix the issue.
    Repair the issue causing the problem.
    Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed.
    Retest to ensure no new problems have emerged.
