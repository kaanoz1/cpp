# Expressions:


In general programming, an **expression** is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value. 

The process of executing an expression is called **evaluation**, and the resulting value produced is called the result of the expression (also sometimes called the **return value**).

In C++, the result of an expression is one of the following:

- A value (most commonly)
- An object or a function.
- Nothing. (void functions);

When an expression is evaluated, each of the terms inside the expression are evaluated, until a **single value** remains.


```cpp
int a = 10;
int c = 20;
int d = 2;
int e = 7;

int get_b() { 
    return 5;
}

int result = ( ( (a + get_b()) * (c / d) ) - 5 ) % e;
```


When an expression is used in an expression statement, any result generated by the expression is discarded (because it is not used). For example, when the expression x = 5 evaluates, the return value of operator= is discarded. And that’s fine, because we just wanted to assign 5 to x anyway.w
