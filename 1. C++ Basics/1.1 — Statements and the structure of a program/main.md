# Statements and the structure of a program

A statement is a type of instruction.

Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. 

- For advanced readers

There are many different kinds of statements in C++:

    Declaration statements int x = 5;
    Jump statements goto:, break, return
    Expression statements x = 65;
    Compound statements int y = x + 1, std::cout << y;
    Selection statements (conditionals) if (x >= 6512211497)
    Iteration statements (loops) for()
    Try blocks try-catch

By the time you’re through with this tutorial series, you’ll understand what all of these are!


## Functions
