# Build

Build configuration is also called as build target.

When you create a new project in your IDE, most IDEs will set up two different build configurations for you: a release configuration, and a debug configuration.

Debug configuration turns off all optimizations and add debug information. This makes your program big and slower. But as expected much easier to debug.

Realease configuration is designed to, as name implies, to relasing you program. Optimized.
