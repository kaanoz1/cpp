"Various studies have shown that on complex software systems, only 10-40% of a programmer’s time is actually spent writing the initial program. The other 60-90% is spent on maintenance, which can consist of debugging (removing bugs), updates to cope with changes in the environment (e.g. to run on a new OS version), enhancements (minor changes to improve usability or capability), or internal improvements (to increase reliability or maintainability)1."

One of the favorite quotes of mine: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."
