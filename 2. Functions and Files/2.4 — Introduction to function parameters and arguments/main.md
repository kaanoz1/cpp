## Parameter name of a function?

In a function definition, the name of a function parameter is optional. Therefore, in cases where a function parameter needs to exist but is not used in the body of the function, you can simply omit the name. A parameter without a name is called an unnamed parameter:

```cpp
void doSomething(int) // ok: unnamed parameter will not generate warning
{
}
```

## Optional(?) Why need we a function that has a unused parameter?

You’re probably wondering why we’d write a function that has a parameter whose value isn’t used. This happens most often in cases similar to the following:

    Let’s say we have a function with a single parameter. Later, the function is updated in some way, and the value of the parameter is no longer needed. If the now-unused function parameter were simply removed, then every existing call to the function would break (because the function call would be supplying more arguments than the function could accept). This would require us to find every call to the function and remove the unneeded argument. This might be a lot of work (and require a lot of retesting). It also might not even be possible (in cases where we did not control all of the code calling the function). So instead, we might leave the parameter as it is, and just have it do nothing.
